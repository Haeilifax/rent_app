# Lab Notebook

(This is intended to be an append only description of current thoughts, attempted moves, and where I've gone with this project. Any and all information written here may be factually incorrect, and will hopefully be corrected later in the note if it is. See https://hamatti.org/posts/how-i-take-work-notes-as-a-developer/ for further details about the goal of this note)

## 2025-06-10

- We have begun using Claude Code for this project to test it out
- Initial commit forthcoming -- at the end of last session we determined what terraform files to add to .gitignore
- Current status of project is:
    - GET requests function
    - Webpage aesthetics are in the process of being improved
    - POST requests for adding CollectedRents are the next big goal
    - Experimentation with LLM Agents and code generation in general is an additional overarching goal, and may steal focus from the direct improvements of the product (for the currently more important goal of self-improvement and exploration)

- Goals for today:
    - Commit everything currently in repo as appropriate
    - Use vanilla.css to improve the aesthetic of the webpage and have this display appropriately from the lambda function
